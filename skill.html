                                <p>I used HTML with pretty much every assignment and project that I worked on during my
                                    bootcamp. HTML is incredibly important and it was the first thing we were taught in
                                    the bootcamp. I'm glad I became familiar with it first because the simplicity HTML
                                    increased my confidence and let me know I could be a sofware engineer.</p>

                                <p>I also used CSS with every project and assignment that I did for the bootcamp that
                                    was deployed to the web. I'm very proficient with CSS and enjoyed using it to style
                                    my web pages. CSS is another technology that is relatively simple to learn and it's
                                    the second technology we learned during the bootcamp. Becoming skilled at CSS also
                                    boosted my confidence and made me feel like a real software engineer.</p>

                                <p>We spent most of the bootcamp learning and using Javscript. It was difficult at first
                                    because it is so different from HTML and CSS but after getting the hang of it, I
                                    realized how important it is. It adds logic to the projects I worked on and it's the
                                    most important programming language that we learned. It makes everything else we
                                    learned just a little bit easier to digest.

                                <p>I did not like working with bootstrap at first because I felt that the grid system
                                    was too complicated. I also had trouble early on trying to style around bootstrap.
                                    Now, I use bootstrap for every frontend project that I do. I couldn't imagine doing
                                    anything frontend without using bootstrap. I like it because it's a templating
                                    technology, which allows me to pick and choose ready-made elements that I find
                                    useful. Also because it makes my projects look so much more slick and polished. I
                                    also like that it has built-in mobile responsivity, so I don't have to use media
                                    queries.

                                <p>Jquery is cool because it simplifies Javascript code. You can write in 50 lines of
                                    code what it used to take 100 lines of code to write. The first time I used it was
                                    for the Crystal Collector assignment. The only thing that I don't like about it is
                                    that node.js doesn't like it, so I could only use it for frontend applications.</p>

                                <p>I liked MySQL because it allowed me to save user input into a database. The first
                                    time I used it was for the Friend Finder application. I did find the technology a
                                    bit cumbersome and clunky to use, but I do understand its benefit.</p>

                                <p>Firebase was the first database technology that we used. I used it for the train
                                    scheduler assignment. This is the database that saves all of the train information
                                    that the user types in. When I first saw it in class, it blew my mind. Up until that
                                    point, everything we were typing in didn't stay on screen after we refreshed. The
                                    database allows everything to stay exactly as it is.

                                <p>I prefer using MongoDB over using MySql because it is easier to use and less clunky.
                                    I used it for the Clicky Game assignment. The mongoose npm package made database

                                    <p>I liked using Node.js and was blown away by the technology when we learned it in
                                        class. I like it because it allows you to write backend code that doesn't have a
                                        user interface. It's actually simpler because you don't have to write any HTML
                                        or CSS. The first time we worked in Node was for the LIRI assignment.</p>

                                    <p>I hated using handlebars. I get that it's important because it allows you to
                                        update the DOM, but it was so difficult to use and fro what I understand, it's

                                        popular these days because there is so much that you can do with it. It's very
                                        robust and allows you to power your application while using backend code. The
                                        first time we used it was for the Clicky Game assignment but we used it a lot
                                        after that and even had to implement it into our final project in some way.</p>

                                    <p>Git isn't really a programming language but it is a technology that we had to
                                        become familiar with because we used it everyday. The first thing we did on day
                                        one was generate SSH keys so we could connect our Github accounts to our
                                        computers and push our code to Github. We learned a few basic commands at first
                                        and learned even more as the program progressed. Git is a technology that i'll
                                        be using for the rest of my career and I'm so glad that I became familiar with
                                        it during my bootcamp. </p>
